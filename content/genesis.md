Sitting here in my living room in DC, writing my first blog post on my shiny new website, I'm tempted to wax philosophical with deep questions, like "Who am I? Why am I here? What's the point..?"

## Who Am I?

I'm Chris, a proud Dad and Grandpa, eternal dogfriend, and pragmatic but hopeful futurist. I'm a software solutions architect and consultant by day, and I have broad interests that keep me busy otherwise.

I've spent some years learning and practicing the principles of permaculture, a design system for... designing systems, in a way that complements nature and economizes natural resource flows. My deeper understanding of nature informs my efforts in understanding and optimizing information systems, economic systems, political and cultural systems. I don't specialize...

>A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.

-Robert A. Heinlein

## Why Am I Here?

This site is a learning tool for me as I explore web development, after spending most of my career in servers and databases. I've been building software for 20 years, but I'm learning more now than ever before. I'm awakening to the potential of blockchains and decentralized technologies, mostly because of their impact on how we organize, govern, and transact with fellow humans.

Ironically, my interest in blockchain spurred my interest in creating user interfaces like this site. Blockchain technology is pretty esoteric, can be difficult to explain, and though public blockchains are "transparent", the technical skills required to interact with them create a kind of opacity.

In short, the best way to get people to take advantage of the features of public, permissionless, immutable transaction ledgers (and other decen-tech) is to build great user experiences to shield them from having to understand how these technologies work.

## What's the Point?

That, dear human, is for you to decide.

For me, The Point is to bring all my diverse passions to bear working on daring, impactful, disruptive projects with great people. One thing I've learned building software products is that we humans create our best works in teams. I'm a big fan of mixing business with play and my personal interests.

I want to have a blast while changing the world. Stay tuned for updates.
